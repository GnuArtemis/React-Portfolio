        "description": "Our group's goal with this project is to create a simple, accessible tool that can be used for learning basic music theory at an approximately 5th-grade level. By way of a virtual keyboard, users can designate note combinations, and upon submission, an analysis of the chord (root and quality, or interval type if less than 3 unique notes) will be displayed. The program displays an exact match if one can be found, and the most likely result with side list of less likely results if no exact match exists. Upon recieving a chordal input, users can also seek out further information about each chord, with a piano representation, a sound example, and in certain situations a definition.",

You might bewhole wheat bread and Dumbledore from Harry Potter, but what do those results have in common? What unique information is offered? This app relates users, quiz results, and quizzes through a log in system, backed by mysql and node. Additionally, users can create their own quizzes for the benefit of themselves and other users. For more technical information, please refer to the Github repository.",

All users may also use the Garden Planner in order to design their garden, although only logged in users can permanently save their garden or display them in the gallery. Logged in users can save their favorite plants for future reference and for use in their garden planner.",
